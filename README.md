# TTGO T5 E-Paper Weather Station.
After making my previous video TTGO T-Display OpenWeatherOneCall Mashup, I thought what about my TTGO T5 ePaper fans? So Lets build a TTGO T5 ePaper Weather Station. 
I'm going to use this U8G2 fonts library that I featured in TTGO T5 E-Paper Custom Images and Example Sketches. This gives you flexibility for your screen layout with so many fonts to choose from. I have created an example sketch to determine which U8G2 font I want to use and how to lay it out on the screen. Now let's see how to mash this up with OpenWeatherOneCall example sketch Simple Latitude Longitude Weather Example. 
You are going to want to watch my previous video TTGO T-Display OpenWeatherOneCall Mashup o capture all the details around working with the OpenWeatherOneCall library and OpenWeatherMap.
